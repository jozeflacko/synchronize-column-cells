# swipe-between screen and synchronize row

## Demo how to synchronize rows between 3 columns

Notice when you click in 1 column into some row, corecponding cells in other rows will get aligned so then when you scroll to the left or right you are on expected same row, but in different column (event when height of cells in every column are different!)
